User mode components need DiscUtils.dll and libewf.dll in order to mount
certain disk image file formats.

DiscUtils.dll
-------------
DiscUtils.dll is a .NET managed DLL that is used to access several kinds of
virtual disk image files, such as VHD, VDI, VMDK. DiscUtils.dll is included in
Arsenal Image Mounter and does not need to be installed separately.

Sources for DiscUtils are based on the repository at
https://github.com/DiscUtils/DiscUtils and forked into a version with added
features for analyzing NTFS internal structures etc. The forked version is
maintained here:
https://github.com/LTRData/DiscUtils

libewf.dll
----------
libewf.dll is a native, unmanaged, DLL that is dynamically linked by Arsenal
Image Mounter when needed. It is primarily needed to mount EnCase style
forensic image files. Arsenal Image Mounter works without this DLL file, but
then without possibility to mount such image files. Because this is an
unmanaged DLL file, it needs to be located in either the same directory as the
EXE file or in any other directory referenced in the system PATH environment
variable. It also needs to be built for the correct machine architecture, for
example x86 or x64.

libewf.dll sources can be downloaded from libewf project website:
https://github.com/libyal/libewf

There is also a 7-zip archive with DLL binaries for each of the x86 and x64
architectures in the libewf subdirectory.
